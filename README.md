# Hi, Iâ€™m @Jdollx :tropical_fish:
A marine biologist turned programmer with a deep passion for music. My journey from the depths of marine science to the digital world of computer science began with the creation of a Discord server. This project sparked my interest in coding, leading me to teach myself Python and ultimately enroll at Western Governors University. I learned Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Version Control, and Java, which I currently use to code.

I am currently working on building a HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP website for the Discord server and adding additional functionalities to the Discord Bot. I have also completed several projects through my coursework involving both full-stack and back-end Java techniques and technologies.
